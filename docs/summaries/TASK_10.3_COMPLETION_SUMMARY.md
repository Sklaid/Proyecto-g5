# Task 10.3 Completion Summary: SLI/SLO Configuration Documentation

## Task Overview

**Task:** 10.3 Document SLI/SLO configuration  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Requirements:** 4.1, 4.2, 4.3

## Task Requirements Verification

### ✅ Requirement 1: Explain how to define custom SLIs

**Location:** `SLI_SLO_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` - Section "Defining Custom SLIs"

**Coverage:**
- Step-by-step guide to identify user-centric metrics
- Multiple measurement methods (percentile-based, threshold-based)
- Detailed examples for:
  - Latency SLI (P95, P99)
  - Availability SLI (success rate)
  - Error Rate SLI
- Implementation instructions using Prometheus recording rules
- Verification steps

**Example provided:**
```yaml
sli:
  name: "API Latency P95"
  metric: "http_server_duration_milliseconds"
  aggregation: "histogram_quantile"
  percentile: 0.95
  threshold: 200  # milliseconds
```

### ✅ Requirement 2: Document how to adjust SLO targets

**Location:** `SLI_SLO_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` - Section "Configuring SLO Targets"

**Coverage:**
- Factors to consider when setting SLO targets
- Common SLO targets by service type
- Downtime allowance table for different SLO levels
- Step-by-step instructions to:
  1. Update recording rules
  2. Update alert thresholds
  3. Update dashboard thresholds
  4. Reload configuration
- Practical examples with actual file paths and code snippets

**Example provided:**
```yaml
slos:
  - name: "API Availability"
    target: 99.9  # 99.9% success rate
    window: 30d   # 30-day rolling window
```

### ✅ Requirement 3: Provide examples of error budget calculations

**Location:** `SLI_SLO_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` - Section "Error Budget Calculations"

**Coverage:**
- Clear explanation of error budget concept
- Mathematical formulas with examples
- Calculations for:
  - Availability SLO error budgets
  - Latency SLO error budgets
- Prometheus queries for:
  - Total error budget
  - Consumed error budget
  - Remaining error budget
  - Error budget percentage
- Error budget policy framework
- Three detailed practical examples with real numbers

**Example calculation:**
```
SLO: 99.9% success rate
Total requests: 1,000,000
Error Budget = (1 - 0.999) × 1,000,000 = 1,000 errors allowed

If 300 errors occurred:
Consumed = 300 errors (30%)
Remaining = 700 errors (70%)
```

### ✅ Requirement 4: Explain burn rate alerting strategy

**Location:** `SLI_SLO_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` - Section "Burn Rate Alerting Strategy"

**Coverage:**
- Detailed explanation of burn rate concept
- Mathematical formula with examples
- Multi-window multi-burn-rate approach (Google SRE best practices)
- Alert configuration with:
  - Critical alerts (14.4x burn rate)
  - High alerts (6x burn rate)
  - Warning alerts (3x burn rate)
- Explanation of why two windows are used
- Complete Prometheus alert rule examples
- Three burn rate calculation scenarios with interpretations

**Example alert configuration:**
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "Critical Burn Rate"
    long_window: 1h
    long_burn_rate: 14.4
    short_window: 5m
    short_burn_rate: 14.4
    action: "Page on-call engineer"
```
