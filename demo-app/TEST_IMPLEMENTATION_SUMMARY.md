# Integration Tests Implementation Summary

## Task 3.3: Write integration tests for Collector

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Main Integration Test Suite
**File**: `demo-app/src/collector.integration.test.js`

Comprehensive integration tests covering:

#### Test Suite 1: Collector receives OTLP data from demo app
- Verifies collector receives metrics via OTLP protocol
- Verifies collector receives traces via OTLP protocol
- Validates collector's internal metrics show data acceptance

#### Test Suite 2: Metrics are exported to Prometheus format
- Validates Prometheus format on collector's metrics endpoint (port 8889)
- Verifies application metrics are queryable in Prometheus
- Confirms custom business metrics are exported correctly

#### Test Suite 3: Traces are forwarded to Tempo
- Verifies traces are successfully forwarded to Tempo backend
- Validates trace context and span information is preserved
- Tests error trace handling and storage

#### Test Suite 4: End-to-end telemetry pipeline
- Complete pipeline validation from app → collector → backends
- Tests with diverse traffic patterns (success, errors, timeouts)
- Verifies all components work together correctly

### 2. Test Runner Scripts

#### Windows Script
**File**: `demo-app/run-integration-tests.bat`
- Automated test execution for Windows
- Starts services, runs tests, shows results
- Includes error handling and log display

#### Linux/Mac Script
**File**: `demo-app/run-integration-tests.sh`
- Automated test execution for Unix-based systems
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Service health checks and cleanup options

### 3. Documentation

#### Comprehensive Guide
**File**: `demo-app/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`
- Detailed overview of test architecture
- Step-by-step running instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- CI/CD integration examples
- Requirements mapping

#### Quick Start Guide
**File**: `demo-app/QUICK_START_TESTS.md`
- Quick reference for running tests
- Service URLs and endpoints
- Common troubleshooting tips
- Test coverage checklist

#### Main README Update
**File**: `README.md`
- Added integration tests section
- Quick start commands for all platforms
- Links to detailed documentation

### 4. Configuration Files

#### Tempo Configuration
**File**: `tempo/tempo.yaml`
- OTLP receiver configuration (gRPC and HTTP)
- Local storage backend setup
- Metrics generator configuration
- Required for integration tests to work

#### Prometheus Configuration
**File**: `prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- Scrape configuration for OTel Collector
- Self-monitoring setup
- Recording rules directory reference
- Required for metrics validation

#### Prometheus Rules Directory
**File**: `prometheus/rules/.gitkeep`
- Placeholder for future recording rules
- Referenced in prometheus.yml

### 5. Package.json Updates
**File**: `demo-app/package.json`
- Added `test:integration` script
- Separated unit tests from integration tests
- Configured to run integration tests sequentially

## Requirements Verified

✅ **Requirement 1.3**: OpenTelemetry SDK sends metrics and traces to Collector  
✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Collector exports metrics to Prometheus  
✅ **Requirement 3.1**: Collector exports traces to Tempo  

## Test Features

### Robust Testing
- Built-in retry logic with configurable timeouts
- Polling mechanism for async data propagation
- Graceful handling of service startup delays
- Idempotent tests that can run multiple times

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Tests all three components of the telemetry pipeline
- Validates both success and error scenarios
- Checks data format and content correctness
- Verifies end-to-end data flow

### Developer-Friendly
- Clear test descriptions and assertions
- Helpful error messages
- Automated setup and teardown
- Multiple ways to run tests (scripts, npm, manual)

### CI/CD Ready
- Can run in automated pipelines
- Configurable service URLs via environment variables
- Exit codes for pass/fail detection
- Log output for debugging failures

## How to Use

### Quick Test (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows
cd demo-app
run-integration-tests.bat

# Linux/Mac
cd demo-app
chmod +x run-integration-tests.sh
./run-integration-tests.sh
```

### Manual Test
```bash
# 1. Start services
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Wait 30 seconds for services to be ready

# 3. Run tests
cd demo-app
npm run test:integration
```

### Custom Configuration
```bash
DEMO_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
COLLECTOR_PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:8889 \
PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090 \
TEMPO_URL=http://localhost:3200 \
npm run test:integration
```

## Files Created

1. `demo-app/src/collector.integration.test.js` - Main test suite
2. `demo-app/run-integration-tests.bat` - Windows runner
3. `demo-app/run-integration-tests.sh` - Unix runner
4. `demo-app/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` - Comprehensive documentation
5. `demo-app/QUICK_START_TESTS.md` - Quick reference
6. `demo-app/TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file
7. `tempo/tempo.yaml` - Tempo configuration
8. `prometheus/prometheus.yml` - Prometheus configuration
9. `prometheus/rules/.gitkeep` - Rules directory placeholder

## Files Modified

1. `demo-app/package.json` - Added test:integration script
2. `README.md` - Added integration tests section

## Next Steps

The integration tests are now complete and ready to use. To run them:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. Run the test script for your platform
3. Review test results and logs

For the next task in the implementation plan, proceed to **Task 4.1: Create Prometheus configuration** (already partially completed as part of this task).

## Notes

- Tests are designed to run against a local Docker Compose environment
- All tests include proper cleanup and don't leave side effects
- Tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- Configuration files created here will be used by subsequent tasks
