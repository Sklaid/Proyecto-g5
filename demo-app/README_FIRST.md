# üöÄ Integration Tests - READ THIS FIRST

## Current Situation

You tried to run the integration tests but encountered an error because **Docker is not installed** on your system.

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Install Docker Desktop (Recommended) ‚≠ê

1. **Download Docker Desktop**
   - Visit: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Click "Download for Windows"
   - Run the installer

2. **Install and Start Docker**
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - Restart your computer if prompted
   - Launch Docker Desktop
   - Wait for it to start (whale icon in system tray)

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```cmd
   docker --version
   docker compose version
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\sklai\OneDrive\Documentos\UNI\2025-2\DEvops\Proyecto-g5\demo-app
   run-integration-tests.bat
   ```

### Option 2: Review Test Implementation (No Docker Needed) üìñ

If you just want to review what was implemented without running the tests:

**Files to Review:**
- `src/collector.integration.test.js` - Main test suite
- `INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `QUICK_START_TESTS.md` - Quick reference
- `TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - What was built
- `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` - Validation checklist

## What Was Implemented ‚úÖ

The integration tests are **complete and ready to run** once Docker is installed. They test:

1. ‚úÖ Collector receives OTLP data from demo app
2. ‚úÖ Metrics are exported to Prometheus format
3. ‚úÖ Traces are forwarded to Tempo
4. ‚úÖ Complete end-to-end telemetry pipeline

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [SETUP_PREREQUISITES.md](SETUP_PREREQUISITES.md) | Detailed setup instructions |
| [DOCKER_COMPOSE_GUIDE.md](DOCKER_COMPOSE_GUIDE.md) | Docker Compose command reference |
| [INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](INTEGRATION_TESTS.md) | Complete test documentation |
| [QUICK_START_TESTS.md](QUICK_START_TESTS.md) | Quick reference guide |
| [TEST_CHECKLIST.md](TEST_CHECKLIST.md) | Validation checklist |

## Time Estimate

- **Docker Desktop installation**: 10-15 minutes
- **First-time setup**: 5-10 minutes
- **Running tests**: 1-2 minutes

**Total**: ~20-30 minutes for first-time setup

## System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 64-bit
- 4GB RAM available
- 10-20GB disk space
- Internet connection (for Docker image downloads)

## The Error You Saw

```
[ERROR] docker-compose not found. Please install Docker Compose.
```

**Why?** The test script needs Docker to start the services (demo-app, collector, Prometheus, Tempo).

**Solution?** Install Docker Desktop (includes Docker Compose).

## What Happens After Docker is Installed?

The `run-integration-tests.bat` script will:

1. ‚úÖ Detect Docker Compose (V1 or V2)
2. ‚úÖ Start all services with `docker compose up -d`
3. ‚úÖ Wait 30 seconds for services to be ready
4. ‚úÖ Run the integration tests
5. ‚úÖ Show results (pass/fail)
6. ‚úÖ Display logs if tests fail

## Can I Run Tests Without Docker?

**Short answer**: No, not easily.

**Long answer**: You would need to manually install and configure:
- Node.js application
- OpenTelemetry Collector
- Prometheus
- Tempo
- Grafana

This is complex and error-prone. **Docker Compose automates all of this.**

## Next Steps

### If You Want to Run the Tests:
1. Read [SETUP_PREREQUISITES.md](SETUP_PREREQUISITES.md)
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. Run `run-integration-tests.bat`

### If You Just Want to Review:
1. Read [TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
2. Review [src/collector.integration.test.js](src/collector.integration.test.js)
3. Check [INTEGRATION_TESTS.md](INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)

## Questions?

**Q: Do I need Docker Desktop or just Docker?**  
A: Docker Desktop is recommended for Windows. It includes everything you need.

**Q: Is Docker Desktop free?**  
A: Yes, for personal use, education, and small businesses.

**Q: Can I use WSL 2 instead?**  
A: Docker Desktop uses WSL 2 on Windows. You need both.

**Q: How much disk space do I need?**  
A: About 10-20GB for Docker images and containers.

**Q: Will this slow down my computer?**  
A: Docker uses 2-4GB RAM when running. You can stop it when not needed.
