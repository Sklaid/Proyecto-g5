   - Follows Google SRE best practices
   
2. **High Latency P95 Exceeding SLI** (High)
   - Threshold: 200ms
   - 5-minute evaluation window
   
3. **High Error Rate Above 1%** (Critical)
   - Immediate alert for error rates > 1%
   - 2-minute evaluation window
   
4. **Anomaly Detected by ML Model** (High)
   - Triggered by anomaly detector service
   - Includes confidence and deviation information

**Infrastructure Alerts**:
5. **Service Down** (Critical)
   - Monitors service availability
   
6. **High Memory Usage** (Warning)
   - Threshold: 400MB
   
7. **High CPU Usage** (Warning)
   - Threshold: 80%

**Notification Configuration**:
- Webhook contact point for testing
- Severity-based routing (critical, high, warning)
- Configurable repeat intervals
- Alert grouping by alertname and service

### ✅ 6.6 Add Grafana service to Docker Compose
- Defined grafana service with official image (grafana/grafana:latest)
- Mounted provisioning directories for datasources, dashboards, and alerting
- Created persistent volume for Grafana data
- Exposed port 3000 (mapped to 3001 on host to avoid conflict with demo-app)
- Set default admin credentials via environment variables (admin/admin)
- Enabled unified alerting
- Configured health checks

**Configuration in docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:latest
  container_name: grafana
  volumes:
    - ./grafana/provisioning:/etc/grafana/provisioning
    - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana
  environment:
    - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
    - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    - GF_USERS_ALLOW_SIGN_UP=false
    - GF_UNIFIED_ALERTING_ENABLED=true
    - GF_ALERTING_ENABLED=false
  ports:
    - "3001:3000"
  networks:
    - observability-network
  depends_on:
    - prometheus
    - tempo
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "wget", "--quiet", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:3000/api/health"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
```

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- **4.1**: Visualize SLIs (latency P95/P99) in Grafana dashboards
- **4.2**: Display error rate as percentage with SLO targets
- **4.3**: Calculate and show error budget, burn rate, and SLO-driven alerts
- **5.1**: Application performance metrics visualization
- **5.2**: Request duration, throughput, and error breakdown
- **5.3**: Distributed tracing dashboard with trace search and service dependencies
- **6.3**: Alerting on error budget consumption and anomaly detection
- **8.3**: Alert integration for CI/CD pipeline notifications

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Start the Stack
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Access Grafana
- URL: http://localhost:3001
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

### 3. Verify Dashboards
Navigate to **Dashboards** and verify:
- ✅ SLI/SLO Dashboard
- ✅ Application Performance Dashboard
- ✅ Distributed Tracing Dashboard

### 4. Verify Datasources
Navigate to **Configuration** → **Data sources** and verify:
- ✅ Prometheus (http://prometheus:9090)
- ✅ Tempo (http://tempo:3200)

### 5. Verify Alerts
Navigate to **Alerting** → **Alert rules** and verify:
- ✅ 7 alert rules configured
- ✅ Contact point configured (webhook-notifications)
- ✅ Notification policies configured

### 6. Test Alerting
Generate test conditions:
```bash
# Test high error rate
for i in {1..100}; do curl http://localhost:3000/api/error; done

# Test high latency
for i in {1..50}; do curl http://localhost:3000/api/slow; done

# Test service down
docker-compose stop demo-app
```

Check alerts in **Alerting** → **Alert groups**

## Next Steps

With Task 6 complete, the next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- **Task 7**: Implement Anomaly Detector service
  - Create Python service with Holt-Winters algorithm
  - Integrate with Prometheus for metrics
  - Generate anomaly alerts

- **Task 8**: Create GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
  - Build and test workflows
  - Docker image building
  - Deployment automation

- **Task 9**: Create Kubernetes deployment manifests
  - Helm charts or Kustomize overlays
  - Production-ready configurations

## Notes

- The alerting system uses Grafana's unified alerting (new alerting system)
- Legacy alerting is disabled (`GF_ALERTING_ENABLED=false`)
- Webhook notifications are configured for testing; production should use PagerDuty, Slack, or email
- All dashboards use template variables for filtering by service and time range
- Dashboards are automatically provisioned on Grafana startup
- Alert rules follow Google SRE best practices for multi-window burn rate alerting

Comprehensive documentation has been created:
- `ALERTING_CONFIGURATION.md` - Detailed alerting documentation with examples and troubleshooting
- Dashboard JSON files include descriptions and annotations
- Alert rules include detailed annotations for investigation
